        <h1>4/12/61</h1><!-- First Battle -->
        <p>~Confederates attack Fort Sumter~</p>
        <p>I knew this would happen, I knew that the Confederates would strike at us.</p>
        <p>This war was never avoidable because of the idiocy of slavery</p>
        <p>it needs to be abolished!</p>
        <p>I just can't beleive that they would attack first.</p>
        <p>I mean, we are superior in almost every way over the confederates!</p>
        <p>You know why they got the first strike? Because we are cowards!</p>
        <p>I need to volenteer for the army! Make my country proud!</p>
        <p>I'm going to volenteer for the military to fight off the traitorous Confederates!</p>
        <p>I, Ulysses Simpson Grant, will make the Union proud!</p>
        
        <h1>10/22/62</h1> <!-- Emancipation Proclamation -->
        <p>~Emancipation Proclamation~</p>
        <p>It is about time that slavery was outlawed for the Confederates!</p>
        <p>This has not only weakened the south, but has freed the slaves!</p>
        <p>Today is truely a great day in history!</p>
        <p>Although the Union has been losing battles, this might just turn the</p>
        <p>tide in our favor!</p>
        
        <h1>4/4/63</h1> <!-- Vicksburg -->
        <p>~Vicksburg~</p>
        <p>This was by far one of my most important victories for the Union</p>
        <p>By capturing Vicksburg, I managed to cut off their main supply route for the rest of the Confederates</p>
        <p>After capturing Port Gibson, I was able to cut off Fort Vicksburg's supplies by destroying rail roads and surround</p>
        <p>the port until they finally surrendered.</p>
        <p>Throughout this battle I managed to outsmart the leading commander of the Confederate, Pemberton, by</p>
        <p>doing the exact opposite of what he expected.</p>
        <p>After ages of combat, they finally agreed to unconditional surrender.</p>
        
        <h1>7/4/63</h1> <!-- Gettysburg -->
        <p>~Pickett's Charge~</p>
        <p>I heard that, thankfully, General Meade was able to drive off Lee's forces from invading the Gettysburg.</p>
        <p>To my knowledge, this is the first loss on Lee's side since this war began!</p>
        <p>Maybe this could mean a turn of tide in this never ending war.</p>
        <p>Although it was still frightening how far they got on Union soil...</p>
        
        <h1>7/18/63</h1><!-- NYC Draft -->
        <p>~New York Draft Riots~</p>
        <p>The people in the North who oppose the draft are fools!</p>
        <p>Who wouldn't want to support the Union in this war?</p>
        <p>The draft is <s>nessesary</s> absolutely nessesary to ensure our victory in this civil war.</p>
        <p>If I were drafted, I would serve my country loyally!</p>
        
        <h1>12/21/64</h1> <!-- Sherman March -->
        <p>~Sherman's March~</p>
        <p>I think it's about time that we had a General (besides me)</p>
        <p>who knows what they'r doing!</p>
        <p>His tactics are great because they scare the Confederates and</p>
        <p>feed his troops for free!</p>
        <p>I'm also extremely happy that McClellan is not longer in command</p>
        <p>He was just terrible...</p>
        
        <h1>4/9/65</h1><!-- Surrender -->
        <p>~Lee Surrenders~</p>
        <p>Although I should be celebrating today, upon Lee's surrender, I feel saddness.</p>
        <p>The deep saddness that only those who faught their brothers would understand</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, I am glad that Lee surrendered to me and that this dreadful war is finally over</p>
        <p>even though they were given conditions upon their surrender.</p>
        <p>It took me about 4 years of wearing down their army until they finally surrendered.</p>
        <p>I hope that the Union can recover from this war, as that we don't have another battle of</p>
        <p>this magnitude again.</p>
        
        <h1>4/15/65</h1> <!-- Lincoln's assassination -->
        <p>~Lincoln's Assasination~</p>
        <p>I can't believe it... the war was finally over!</p>
        <p>And for this... scoundrel to assassinate Lincoln?</p>
        <p>It's insane! The war was finally over! The peace process was just starting!</p>
        <p>What kind of a traitor could have done this.</p>
        <p>This will put the peace process far behind in the peace making process with this</p>
        <p>idiot of a Vice President Andrew Johnson!</p>
        <p>This could lead to disunion within the Union...</p>
