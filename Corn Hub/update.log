May the 4th be with you!

1.013 - 5/3/17
Renamed the screen melter to screen melt

1.012e - 5/1/17
Added the screen melter & another extremely important file

1.012d - 4/30/17
Added a runme.exe file for the updater so that the updater updates itself, and added comments to the file-list.txt

1.012 - 4/29/17
Added an updater that relies on the update.log file (this one) to update Corn Hub automatically. So don't touch this file unless you want to update Corn Hub

1.011b - 4/21/17
Did many changes, including getting a new news api :( and making it now work on the school computers.  I upgraded some js and added comments in a lot of spots. I also added an update log.
