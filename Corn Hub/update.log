Added an updater that relies on the update.log file (this one) to update Corn Hub automatically. So don't touch this file unless you want to update Corn Hub

Did many changes, including getting a new news api :( and making it now work on the school computers.  I upgraded some js and added comments in a lot of spots. I also added an update log.
